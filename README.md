# Caltech-work
This project demonstrates how to fetch, visualize, and analyze TESS Full-Frame Images (FFIs) from Sector 50, using Python tools such as astropy, lightkurve, and matplotlib. It provides insight into stellar and planetary studies by enabling light curve extraction from any sky region observed by TESS.

Overview:

TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) captures full-frame images every ~30 minutes. These FFIs cover large regions of the sky and are used to analyze brightness variations of stars — crucial for detecting exoplanets, eclipsing binaries, and other variable phenomena.

This repo covers:

Fetching Sector 50 FFIs

Visualizing calibrated images using WCS

Extracting light curves from a 50×50 pixel region

Plotting the extracted data
